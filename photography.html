    <p>In the beginning there were flowers.</p>
    <p>Just like about any amateur photographer – or rather a person who discovered the magic of recording reality – I started from flowers. It is a pleasant feeling to go through your first photos, when you begin to rediscover the beauty of an outtake of the world – usually your home or garden. Out of the first, quite dark, period of my art there remain countless photos of my dogs.</p>
    <p>I have been a professional photographer for four years. You can me on Facebook as <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LillyBlackPhotography/" target="_blank">LillyBlack</a>. I am a graduate of the School of Cultural Animation.</p>
    <p>In photography I value working with people the most. I take great care in showing that we all have that something which makes us unique.</p>
