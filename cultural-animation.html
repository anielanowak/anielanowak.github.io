    <h1>Cultural Animation <small>Bridging the gap between people and culture</small></h1>
    <blockquote>How can you make grown-ups play with soap bubbles in the grass?<br>
    How can you make a group of bored children crawl on the floor acting as caterpillars?<br>
    How can you make a busy family make balloon dogs for each other?
    </blockquote>
    <p class="lead">Animation is motion. Animation is excitement. Animation is transformation.</p>
    <p>As an animator my task is stimulating action, creative thinking and movement through culture. Cultural animation is about absorbing the energy and vibrations of others, reshaping it and then feeding it back to the group.</p>
    <p>Why are people the most important part of animation? There is no animation without people. Animation cannot emerge without an object.</p>
    <p>A true animator allows herself to die. A good animator facilitates and provides tools for the group to grow and become independent and self sufficient. The animatorâ€™s job is done, she becomes annihilated by the group.</p>
